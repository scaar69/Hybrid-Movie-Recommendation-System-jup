Thambivudaiyan,"Documentary, Drama",0,0,"Thambividaiyan', the film which has been courting controversy ever since it was launched early this year, is releasing this week. The story revolves around the difficulties and tough times faced by the farmers of Cauvery Delta in and around the Thanjavur District of Tamil Nadu. Some romance too has been sprinkled in good measure to make the film more interesting.  To star in the film in the lead role, Tamilvanan approached in vain all heroes, right from  When the film was viewed by the screening committee of the Censor Board, it objected to 'certain violent sequences' depicting the farmers' turmoil in a rather forceful manner. When the Board advised the producer to cut down some 'sequences', the latter refused to do so, prompting the Board to promptly ban the movie altogether."

Suriyan Satta Kalloori,Drama,0,0,"There are distinct advantages to watching a Tamil film like SS Moviemakers's Suriyan Satta Kalloori (Suriyan law College), directed by Pawan, with its ridiculously simple theme, one-dimensional characters and clichéd performances. The cast and crew leave you in no doubt about what to expect.  It's been quite some time since you saw what was once a staple of Tamil cinema: college life, where students rarely attended classes, fall in love and live happily ever after.  Well, this movie tries to take itself seriously, which is why it is set against the Government Law College. With its history of caste differences and violence, it is the perfect backdrop for our hero, Surya Narayanan (newcomer Kajni)."
Sagakkal,Drama,0,0,"What happens when a director is inspired by the movies of the 80s era – the era that had explored themes like love and friendship and killed them with melodramatic overdose. Well, you get Sagakkal. Director Muthukumarasamy’s Sagakkal is a retake of the long forgotten eighties with all the excess melodrama surrounding a wafer thin tale of love and friendship.  The movie has an amateurish look and feel. Cinematography is a letdown and songs are just about okay. Director Muthukumarasamy must tune his direction to suit to the sensibilities of the target audience. Otherwise, his product will be stuck in the middle for want of audience."
