# Hybrid MovieRecommendationSystem
These systems gather data from users to enhance suggestions in the future. In this project, collaborative filtering algorithms are used to construct a movie recommendation system. 

## Abstract:​

The requirement to extract useful data from enormous amounts of raw data to generate business solutions has grown as corporate needs have become more essential. The same is true for digital recommendation systems, which are commonplace in consumer-facing businesses like those for books, music, apparel, movies, news, articles, locations, and utilities. These systems gather data from users to enhance suggestions in the future. In this project, collaborative filtering algorithms are used to construct a movie recommendation system. 


## Content-based filtering:

Content-based filtering uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback.

## Collaborative Filtering:

Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user.

## Hybrid filtering:

A hybrid recommendation system is a special type of recommendation system which can be considered as the combination of the content and collaborative filtering method. 

## Dataset:
